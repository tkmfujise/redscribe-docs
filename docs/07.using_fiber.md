# Using Fiber

## What is Fiber?

Ruby provides a class called [Fiber](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Fiber.html) for working with coroutines.

A coroutine is a mechanism that allows you to pause execution and later resume it from where it left off.

In some languages, asynchronous operation using `async/await` are referred to as coroutines.
However, Ruby's `Fiber` uses `yield` and `resume` to pause and resume execution.

To create a Fiber, use `Fiber.new`.

Note that simply calling `Fiber.new` does not start execution.
Let's try it out using the REPL.

```ruby
@fiber = Fiber.new do
  Godot.emit_signal :fiber, 'started'
  Fiber.yield
  Godot.emit_signal :fiber, 'resumed'
end
```
```txt title="Output"
=> "#<Fiber:0x1ab31c76030 (created)>"
```

To start execution, call `resume`.
```ruby
@fiber.resume
```
```txt title="Output"
[ fiber ] signal emitted: 'started'
=> <null>
```

When `Fiber.yield` is called, execution is paused at that point.
To resume, call `resume` again.
```ruby
@fiber.resume
```
```txt title="Output"
[ fiber ] signal emitted: 'resumed'
=> true
```

## Fiber.yield Arguments and Return Values

The arguments passed to `Fiber.yield` will be returned when `resume` is called.

```ruby
@fiber = Fiber.new do
  value = Fiber.yield 'started'
  Godot.emit_signal :fiber, value
end
```
```ruby
@fiber.resume
```
```txt title="Output"
=> "started"
```

The arguments passed to `resume` become the return values of `Fiber.yield`.

```ruby
@fiber.resume 'hello'
```
```txt title="Output"
[ fiber ] signal emitted: "hello"
=> true
```

By using coroutines, you can create features like dialogue systems.

In the next chapter, we'll build a dialogue system example using Fiber.
