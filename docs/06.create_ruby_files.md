# Create Ruby files

## Creating a Ruby file from the FileSystem

To create a Ruby file, right-click within the FileSystem and select **Create New** → **DSL/boot \*.rb**.

<Zoom>
![Create a Ruby file](/img/tutorial/06.create-a-ruby-file.png)
</Zoom>

A dialog will appear—check that the file name is correct, then press **OK** to continue.

</Zoom>

A Ruby file should now be created.


## Opening a Ruby file

To edit a Ruby file, double-click the `.rb` file in the FileSystem.

Its content should now appear in the editor on the main screen.

</Zoom>

Alternatively, if the main screen is set to **ReDScribe**, you can open a file using fuzzy search.

Try pressing `Ctrl-o` (or `Command-o` on macOS).

## Saving a Ruby file

You can save the file by pressing `Ctrl-s` (or `Command-s` on macOS).

Let's try editing the Ruby file in the editor as shown below, then save it.

```ruby title="boot.rb"
def greeting
  Godot.emit_signal :greeting, "Hello from Ruby"
end
```

## Executing a Ruby file from GDScript

First, create a scene and attach a GDScript file as shown below.

```gdscript title="control.gd"
extends Control

@export var res : ReDScribe


func _ready() -> void:
	res.channel.connect(_subscribe)
	res.perform('greeting')


func _subscribe(key: StringName, payload: Variant) -> void:
	print_debug("[subscribe] ", key, ": ", payload)

```

`@export` is an annotation that allows member variables to be edited in Godot's Inspector.

You should now see the **Res** property displayed in the Inspector.

<Zoom>
![Inspector](/img/tutorial/06.redscribe-in-inspector.png)
</Zoom>

Click the **Res** property and select **New ReDScribe**.

Then, click the file icon next to **Boot File** and choose the `boot.rb` file you created earlier.

<Zoom>
![Set boot_file](/img/tutorial/06.set-boot-file.png)
</Zoom>

After making your selection, go ahead and run the scene.

The Output panel should now displayed something like the following:

```txt title="Output"
[subscribe] greeting: Hello from Ruby
   At: res://src/06.create_ruby_files/control.gd:12:_subscribe()
```

In GDScript, you simply write:
```gdscript
res.perform('greeting')
```

By using ReDScribe's **boot_file** variable like this, you can maintain a clean seperation between Ruby and GDScript.

Try making active use of **boot_file** to keep your workflow organized and expressive.
