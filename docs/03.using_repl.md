# Using REPL

Open the REPL, type `1 + 1` and press `Ctrl-Enter`.

The result will be displayed.

</Zoom>

The REPL supports several shortcuts.
* `Ctrl-u` clears the input field
* `Ctrl-k` deletes text after the cursor in the input field
* `Ctrl-l` clears the output field
* `Up arrow (↑)`, `Down arrow (↓)` navigates through input field history
* `Ctrl-[` switches to the Editor tab
* `Ctrl-]` switches back to the REPL tab


The REPL also supports multi-line input, with `Enter` as a newline.

Type the following and press `Ctrl-Enter`.
```ruby
class Foo
  def bar
    'FooBar'
  end
end

Foo.new.bar
```
```txt title="Output"
=> "FooBar"
```

## Emit signals

Try each of the following:
```ruby
foo 'bar'
```
```ruby
Godot.emit_signal :foo, 'bar'
```
```txt title="Output"
[ foo ] method_missing: ["bar"]
=> <null>

[ foo ] signal emitted: "bar"
=> true
```
`=>` represents the return value of the method.
If any signal is emitted, it will be displayed in the output.

Red text is displayed when a **method_missing** channel signal is emitted,
while blue text appears when a **channel** signal is emitted.


## Define methods

Try the following:
```ruby
@count = 0
def up
  @count += 1
end
```
Then, try `up` a few times.
```txt title="Output"
up
=> 1
up
=> 2
up
=> 3
```

```ruby
100.times { up }
@count
```
```txt title="Output"
100.times { up }
=> 100
@count
=> 104
```

:::caution
Local variables are undefined after execution.
So use instance variables like `@count = 0` instead of `count = 0`.

## Use require

mruby doesn't include `require` by default, but ReDScribe provides it as a helper method that loads Ruby files from the root of your Godot project.

```ruby
require 'addons/redscribe/mrblib/math'
```
Run this, if the file loads successfully, it will return `true`.
The file is only loaded once—on subsequent calls, it will return `false`.
```txt title="Output"
=> true
```

After executing `require`, try calling:

```ruby
sin(1)
```
```txt title="Output"
=> 0.8414709848079
```

*addons/redscribe/mrblib/math.rb* calls `extend Math`, making the `sin` method available.

```ruby title="addons/redscribe/mrblib/math.rb"
extend Math
include Math

def π
  PI
end

def √(x)
  sqrt(x)
end

# ...
```


## Reload and initialze the REPL

To initialize the REPL, run:
```ruby
reload!
```

Once initalized, if you call the `up` or `sin` method again, you'll get **method_missing**.
```ruby
up
sin(1)
```
```txt title="Output"
[ up ] method_missing: []
[ sin ] method_missing: [1]
=> <null>
```

That's the basic usage of the REPL.

The REPL can be very helpful—feel free to use it whenever you like!
